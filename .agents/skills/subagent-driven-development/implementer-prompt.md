# Implementer Subagent Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching an implementer subagent.

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Task N: [task name]"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task N: [task name]

    ## Task Description

    [FULL TEXT of task from plan - paste it here, don't make subagent read file]

    ## Context

    [Scene-setting: where this fits, dependencies, architectural context]

    ## Your Job

    Once you're clear on requirements:
    1. Implement exactly what the task specifies
    2. Write tests (following TDD if task says to)
    3. Verify implementation works
    4. Commit your work
    5. Self-review
    6. Report back

    ## Report Format

    - **Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
    - What you implemented
    - What you tested and test results
    - Files changed
    - Any issues or concerns
```
